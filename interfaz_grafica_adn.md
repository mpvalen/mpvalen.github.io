# Welcome to the CELL documentation

**CELL (Cellular Effect Lesions Linker)** is a graphical interface for cell survival predictions based on different simulation chains pre-loaded in the system for different cell lines. The program was written in Python using the PyQt5 library.

## Install

The [repository](https://github.com/mpvalen/interfaz_grafica_adn) has to be downloaded. The following libraries are necessary for the execution,  `python`  should be version 3.X minimum.

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- PyQt5
- scipy
- natsort
- uncertainties

The program allows the use of the [MCDS](https://faculty.washington.edu/trawets/mcds/) (Monte Carlo Damage Simulation) software [[1]](#references)[[2]](#references)[[3]](#references)[[4]](#references) . The latest version of MCDS (3.10A) is required for the correct execution of the program, the folder  `mcds` should be located inside the `INTERFAZ` directory.

## Execution

To use the interface, simply execute `main.py`.
